Ethanol reforming over Pt/Mo2N(111)

This subdirectory contains the Jupyter notebook and Python code that was used for the construction of a Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) model for approximating the transition-state energy for reactions over Pt/Mo2N(111) [1]. The BEP model was fitted to data from references [1] and [2].
